# Overview

This is my very first React project where i will try to use most of the concepts learned so far in the Odin Project React curriculum.

In this project,users can input their information and generate a CV/résumé.

## Setup

The CV generator will have a few sections:
-A section to add general information like name, email and phone number.
-A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study and date of study)
-A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)

An Edit/Submit buttons will also be available for each section and for the whole CV.
